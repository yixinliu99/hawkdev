## Context and Problem Statement
Efficient communication between microservices is critical to the performance and scalability of the auction system. Given the need for high-speed, low-latency communication and type-safe interactions between services such as Auction, User, and other microservices, a suitable inter-service communication protocol is required.

## Considered Options
REST
gRPC

## Decision Outcome
After evaluating the options, we decided to use gRPC for communication between microservices. This choice ensures high-speed, low-overhead communication with robust type safety provided by Protobuf schemas. gRPC's bidirectional streaming capabilities also make it suitable for real-time features, such as auction updates and notifications. While REST remains an option for external APIs, gRPC aligns better with the internal communication needs of the microservices architecture, ensuring performance, scalability, and reliability.
