## Context and Problem Statement
### To enable secure and stateless user authentication in a distributed microservices architecture, a mechanism is needed to verify users' identities and grant access to protected resources. This mechanism must work across multiple services without requiring centralized session management or frequent database queries, while ensuring security and scalability.

## Decision Outcome
### JWT (JSON Web Token) will be used for secure, stateless authentication across the auction system. This decision is based on several key advantages. JWTs enable stateless authentication by encapsulating all necessary authentication information within the token itself, eliminating the need for server-side session storage. Each microservice in the system can independently verify the token without relying on a centralized authentication service, which enhances scalability and reduces latency. Furthermore, JWT is widely supported across various programming languages and frameworks, such as Flask and React, ensuring seamless integration into the system. Security is another strong point of JWTs, as they can be signed using robust algorithms like HMAC or RSA to prevent tampering, and their expiration times help mitigate risks in case of token compromise.
