## Context and Problem Statement
A robust messaging system is required to handle notifications across the auction system. Notifications must be delivered promptly and reliably for various events, including updates on watched items, bidding activity, and auction timelines. Given the decoupled nature of microservices, a system is needed to manage these communications asynchronously, ensuring scalability and resilience.

## Decision Outcome
After evaluating the options, we decided to use RabbitMQ for the notification microservice. RabbitMQ provides a reliable, scalable solution for managing asynchronous communications, allowing the notification service to handle high volumes of events without being tightly coupled to other services. Its support for flexible messaging patterns ensures that notifications such as email alerts for watchlist updates, bid activity, and auction reminders can be efficiently routed to the appropriate users. This decision aligns with the system's requirements for reliability, scalability, and resilience in delivering notifications.
