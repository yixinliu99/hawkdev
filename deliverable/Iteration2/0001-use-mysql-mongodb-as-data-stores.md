# <!-- Use MySQL and MongoDB as data stores of the project -->

## Context and Problem Statement
A relational database and a NoSQL database are needed for the project to adapt different types of data. There are a lot of open-source or proprietary products available for databases. We should select the most suitable databases for our team.


## Considered Options
### Relational Database:
- MySQL
- Postgres

### NoSQL Database:
- MongoDB
- Cassandra

## Decision Outcome
After evaluating the options, we decided to use MySQL for the relational database and MongoDB for the NoSQL database. This choice aligns with our requirements for structured data management and flexible document storage, while also allowing our team to leverage existing experience with these technologies to accelerate development.
